                            day in day out; this is my testimony. <br> <br>I started taking the full range of products around a year after my fourth surgery. Sick of the aching and swelling that lingered in my body I was willing to try anything. After
                            8 months of convincing from my sister in law I finally decided to say yes to a 30 day trial.<br><br>Two weeks in and I started to see incredible results; it was the first time since I was 14 that I had woken up being able to
                            feel and see my knee caps with no swelling. Little did I know this was just the start of some great results; my sleep had drastically improved with great focus and energy each day. The products had helped cut out my snacking
                            of bad foods throughout the work day and blew my performances in Personal Training sessions out of the water! Not to mention the recovery, hard sessions with being able to wake up the next morning feeling fresh and ready to
                            go again.&nbsp;<br><br>A lot of people do not realise the topical benefits of the products either; with my bruising from high contact sports disappearing in 1-2 days verses a week to 2 weeks and the clearing of blocked sinuses
                            and ear aches, to the healing of cuts/burns! I cannot rate these products high enough, I live and breathe them! They have enabled my body to go back to playing the sports that I love!<br></p>

                            and C3 in my neck lead to nerve damage, causing reduced use of my right arm/hand, limited movement in turning my head and inflammation. I was on anti-inflammatories, pain killers and seeing a physio 2-3 times a week and doing
                            Iyenga yoga once a week for pain management. I had cortisone injections, dry needling and acupuncture among other procedures with minimal if any relief.<br><br>2.5 years later I was introduced to Kyani. Expecting increased
                            energy levels - being a Mum of 5 kids and running a business, I was surprised to find that within a few short weeks I had forgotten to take my pain meds and anti-inflammatories, I hadn’t taken them for 2 weeks as the pain was
                            too minimal to prompt me. Soon after, I was no longer requiring my regular physio appointment and have not been back to my sessions or on the meds or anti-inflammatories since.<br><br>I found I was no longer napping on the
                            couch, I had the endurance to last the day until late at night, yet fell asleep easily and slept well, despite being woken during the night by our baby, I felt well rested when I woke up. I have a better quality of life thanks

                            a significant range of vitamins, minerals with little results, under the guidance of a complementary therapist. I was still exhausted, fatigued, had no energy, gaining weight, mentally I was stressed and anxious, sleeping poorly,

                            - these products are truly life changing, it's been 2.5 years and I haven't had a sick day from work, despite significant stressors in life as well as often being surrounded by sick people, never underestimate the value of

                            <li>excellent immune function for myself and bubs. Whilst other mums &amp; bubs around me have been plagued with all sorts of viral complaints we have avoided them all and I can only put this down to Kyani's excellent nutrition</li>

                            health and wellness.&nbsp;<br><br>I didn’t have any major health issues but wanted to live a healthier lifestyle to set an example for my kids and be a more active mother. I am someone who tends to worry a fair bit which leads
                            to a stiff neck and shoulders and quite often angry outbursts. I have also suffered from episodes of low mood on and off for many years.&nbsp;<br><br>Since taking these natural supplements I have noticed huge differences in
                            my everyday life. The stiffness in my neck and shoulders has disappeared (no more massages needed but still appreciated), I am less stressed and able to deal with whatever life throws at me easier. I have less angry outbursts.
                            I am able to exercise more and ride further on my bike than I could before and have great recovery from hard workouts. I chipped some cartilage off my knee skiing 18 months ago which hurt when I tried to jog – but that has
                            now gone as well.&nbsp;<br><br>My immunity has also improved greatly. I went through the whole of last winter without so much as a cold even though everyone else around me had been sick (including most of the students at school).
                            I didn’t think this supplement was going to change much in my life but it has changed my whole life. I feel like a different person to who I was 8 months ago!</p>

                            slowly increasing till I was walking every morning.<br><br>I had an increase in energy, and my mood had improved. After joining bootcamp, I started to increase my Xtreme which made a huge difference to my workouts, I started
                            to lose some weight, which increased my motivation again and also my endurance and stamina. I was finishing my workouts before others and still feeling I had more to give.&nbsp;<br><br>I’ve noticed muscle definition and massive
